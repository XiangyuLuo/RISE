# RISE Package

`RISE` is an R package designed for tackling zero inflation in sequence-based spatial transcriptomic (ST) data by leveraging neighborhood-based regression model.

## Installation

To install the package from Github:

``` r
install.packages("path/to/RISE", repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(RISE)
```

## Example Data

To help users understand the data structure, RISE includes an example dataset, `spot_example`, with two elements:

-   `spot_express`: A sparse matrix of gene expression values with genes as rows and spots as columns.

-   `coordinates`: A matrix containing x and y coordinates for each spot.

Load and print the example data:

``` r
data(spot_example)
print(spot_example$spot_express[1:10,1:10])
print(spot_example$coordinates[1:10,])
```

## RISE Usage

RISE mainly relies on two functions, `FindNeighbors` and `RISE`, with the first focusing on neighboring spots identification and the second imputing the zeros using neighbor-based regression predictions.

The role of `FindNeighbors` function is to let users adjust the number of spot's neighbors through parameter `thresh` (range from 0 to 1), with larger `thresh` including more neighbors. `FindNeighbors` returns a logistic matrix containing the neighbors indicator, which facilitate the direct application in `RISE`. However, there are simple examples to further explore the neighboring spots information.

``` r
# neighbors identification
neighbors <- FindNeighbors(spot_example$coordinates, thresh = 0.3)

# to summarize the number of neighbors
summary(rowSums(neighbors))
hist(rowSums(neighbors), breaks = 200)

# to obtain the neighbors' names
spots <- colnames(neighbors)
neighbor_names <- apply(neighbors, 1, function(x) spots[x])
neighbor_names[["spot29"]]
```
Once the value of `threshold` to identify neighbors is determined by the user, `RISE` function can be used to gain the imputed gene expression matrix.

```r
spot_imputed <- RISE(spot_example$spot_express, spot_example$coordinates, thresh = 0.3)
spot_imputed[1:5,1:5]
spot_example$spot_express[1:5,1:5]
```
